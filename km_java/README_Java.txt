For java projects, add one of the project dirs in this folder.

In each projct dir you will find:
ProjectDir/
    src
        projectName
            aJavaFile.java


If using eclipse, upon creating a project using ProjectDir, it will
create some setting files[.classpath, .project] and a bin dir.
The bin dir will contain a .class of each java file, and is necessary to 
run the related java file it is a copy of.
