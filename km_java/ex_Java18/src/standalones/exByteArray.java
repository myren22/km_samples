//==================================
//==== **** Purpose of this example ****
//==== Show how several ints flow from variable to a byteArray.
//==== Then show to set a new object up with this byteArray.
//==================================
//==== Notes/Oberservations:
// ByteArray and Char[] seem to be the same thing.
// This makes sense as 1 char IS EQUAL to 1 byte.(1char==1byte==8bits)
// Java seems to favor the use of char over byte.
//     - as seen in BufferedReader.
