Types of “batch” files in windows

INI (*.ini) – Initalization file. These set the default variables for the system and programs.
CFG (*.cfg) – These are the configuration files.
SYS (*.sys) – System files, can sometimes be edited, mostly compiled machine code in new versions.
COM (*.com) – Command files. These are the executable files for all the DOS commands. 
                In early versions there was a seperate file for each command. Now, most are inside COMMAND.COM.
CDM (*.cmd) – These were the batch files used in NT operating systems.


Terminals CMDs run by python:
    If python runs patch, it can do it without a console, but then issues are difficult to track. If a command
opens a new console, runs the command, then closes the console on success that is optimal.

This is a command that can be run by python to open a console, change dir to where notepad++ is, run notepad++
with a line number and file to move to, then close.
    
    start cmd /k "cd C:\Program Files\Notepad++ & notepad++.exe -n600 C:\_KM_root_lap\Docs_ENG_Project\engPlotter_2019-06-07.py & exit"
